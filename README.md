# Exoplanet Exploration Project

## Introduction
This project analyzes data from the Kepler space telescope to identify potentially habitable exoplanets. It processes CSV data files containing exoplanet characteristics and filters out those planets that meet specific habitability criteria.

## Features
- Parse large datasets using Node.js streams.
- Filter data based on planet properties such as disposition, insolation flux, and planet radius.
- Output results to a CSV file listing potentially habitable exoplanets.
